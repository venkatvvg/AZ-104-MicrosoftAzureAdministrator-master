# Lab 06 - Implement Traffic Management
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You were tasked with testing managing network traffic targeting Azure virtual machines in the hub and spoke network topology, which Contoso considers implementing in its Azure environment (instead of creating the mesh topology, which you tested in the previous lab). This testing needs to include implementing connectivity between spokes by relying on user defined routes that force traffic to flow via the hub, as well as traffic distribution across virtual machines by using layer 4 and layer 7 load balancers. For this purpose, you intend to use Azure Load Balancer (layer 4) and Azure Application Gateway (layer 7).

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-104%20Exam%20Guide%20-%20Microsoft%20Azure%20Administrator%20Exercise%2010)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

>**Note**: This lab, by default, requires total of 8 vCPUs available in the Standard_Dsv3 series in the region you choose for deployment, since it involves deployment of four Azure VMs of Standard_D2s_v3 SKU. If your students are using trial accounts, with the limit of 4 vCPUs, you can use a VM size that requires only one vCPU (such as Standard_B1s).

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Task 1: Provision the lab environment
+ Task 2: Configure the hub and spoke network topology
+ Task 3: Test transitivity of virtual network peering
+ Task 4: Configure routing in the hub and spoke topology
+ Task 5: Implement Azure Load Balancer
+ Task 6: Implement Azure Application Gateway

## Instructions

### Exercise 1

#### Task 1: Provision the lab environment

In this task, you will deploy four virtual machines into the same Azure region. The first two will reside in a hub virtual network, while each of the remaining two will reside in a separate spoke virtual network.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1.In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, click advanced settings using following:

   ```powershell
   Resource Group -> Use existing -> <6+2>-az104-06-rg1   eg:madalrt-az104-06-rg1 
   ```
   ```powershell
   Storage Account -> Create New -> <6+2>06storage eg:madalrt06storage 
   ```
   ```powershell
   File Share -> Create New -> <6+2>06fs  eg:madalrt06fs  
   ```
    >**Note**: If powershell open automatically click Settings --> Reset user settings, Repeat above steps**.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, click the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, click **Upload** and upload the files **[\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\az104-06-vms-loop-template.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tw80Djo5r7J6HmGUmr65ZPY27fdfLoiq/view?usp=sharing)** and **[\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\az104-06-vms-loop-parameters.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16GZ47cLSt44HLYjnkoFHCU7uMxgLtP85/view?usp=share_link)** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the first resource group that will be hosting the lab environment (replace the '[Azure_region]' placeholder with the name of an Azure region where you intend to deploy Azure virtual machines)(you can use the "(Get-AzLocation).Location" cmdlet to get the region list):

    ```powershell 
    $location = 'eastus'
    ```
    
    Now the resource group name:
    ```powershell
    $rgName = '<6+2>-az104-06-rg1'
    ```
    
    And finally create the resource group in your desired location:
    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgName -Location $location
    ```
    >**Note**: Error Provided resource group already exists, this is due to resource group created during storage account creation **Click Y**.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the three virtual networks and four Azure VMs into them by using the template and parameter files you uploaded:

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/az104-06-vms-loop-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az104-06-vms-loop-parameters.json
   ```
    >**[Screenshot 2](https://github.com/venkatvvg/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-master/blob/master/Instructions/Labs/LAB_06-Implement_Network_Traffic_Management.md)**: Display the output of Resource Group Deployment with Template and parameters files. 

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding to the next step. This should take about 5 minutes.


1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to install the Network Watcher extension on the Azure VMs deployed in the previous step:

   ```powershell
   $rgName = '<6+2>-az104-06-rg1'
   ```
   
   ```powershell
   $location = (Get-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $rgName).location
   ```
   
   ```powershell   
   $vmNames = (Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName).Name
   ```
   
   ```powershell
   foreach ($vmName in $vmNames) {
     Set-AzVMExtension `
     -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
     -Location $location `
     -VMName $vmName `
     -Name 'networkWatcherAgent' `
     -Publisher 'Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher' `
     -Type 'NetworkWatcherAgentWindows' `
     -TypeHandlerVersion '1.4'
   }
   ```

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding to the next step. This should take about 5 minutes.

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 2: Configure the hub and spoke network topology

In this task, you will configure local peering between the virtual networks you deployed in the previous tasks in order to create a hub and spoke network topology.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Resource Groups**.

1. Review the virtual networkson the resource group that you created in the previous task.

    >**Note**: The template you used for deployment of the three virtual networks ensures that the IP address ranges of the three virtual networks do not overlap.

1. In the list of virtual networks, select **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet2**.

1. On the **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet2** blade, select **Properties**. 

1. On the **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet2 \| Properties** blade, record the value of the **Resource ID** property.

1. Navigate back to the list of virtual networks and select **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet3**.

1. On the **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet3** blade, select **Properties**. 

1. On the **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet3 \| Properties** blade, record the value of the **Resource ID** property.

    >**Note**: You will need the values of the ResourceID property for both virtual networks later in this task.

    >**Note**: This is a workaround that addresses the issue with the Azure portal occasionally not displaying the newly provisioned virtual network when creating virtual network peerings.

1. In the list of virtual networks, click **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet01**.

1. On the **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet01** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click **Add**:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | This virtual network: Peering link name | **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet01_to_<6+2>-az104-06-vnet2** |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet2_to_<6+2>-az104-06-vnet01** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |
    | I know my resource ID | enabled |
    | Resource ID | the value of resourceID parameter of **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet2** you recorded earlier in this task |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |

    >**Note**: Wait for the operation to complete.

    >**Note**: This step establishes two local peerings - one from <6+2>-az104-06-vnet01 to <6+2>-az104-06-vnet2 and the other from <6+2>-az104-06-vnet2 to <6+2>-az104-06-vnet01.

    >**Note**: **Allow forwarded traffic** needs to be enabled in order to facilitate routing between spoke virtual networks, which you will implement later in this lab.

1. On the **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet01** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click **Add**:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | This virtual network: Peering link name | **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet01_to_<6+2>-az104-06-vnet3** |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet3_to_<6+2>-az104-06-vnet01** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |
    | I know my resource ID | enabled |
    | Resource ID | the value of resourceID parameter of **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet3** you recorded earlier in this task |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |

    >**Note**: This step establishes two local peerings - one from <6+2>-az104-06-vnet01 to <6+2>-az104-06-vnet3 and the other from <6+2>-az104-06-vnet3 to <6+2>-az104-06-vnet01. This completes setting up the hub and spoke topology (with two spoke virtual networks).

    >**Note**: **Allow forwarded traffic** needs to be enabled in order to facilitate routing between spoke virtual networks, which you will implement later in this lab.

>**[Screenshot 5](https://github.com/venkatvvg/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-master/blob/master/Instructions/Labs/LAB_06-Implement_Network_Traffic_Management.md)**: Show the peerings of <6+2>-az104-06-vnet01.


#### Task 3: Test transitivity of virtual network peering

In this task, you will test transitivity of virtual network peering by using Network Watcher.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Network Watcher**.

1. On the **Network Watcher** blade, expand the listing of Azure regions and verify the service is enabled in region you are using. 

1. On the **Network Watcher** blade, navigate to the **Connection troubleshoot**.

1. On the **Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot** blade, initiate a check with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    > **Note**: It may take a few minutes for the resource group to be listed. If you don't want to wait, try this: delete the Network Watcher, create a new Network Watcher, and then retry Connection Troubleshoot. 

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource group | **<6+2>-az104-06-rg1** |
    | Source type | **Virtual machine** |
    | Virtual machine | **<6+2>-az104-06-vm0** |

    | URI, FQDN or IPv4 | **10.62.0.4** |
    | Protocol | **TCP** |
    | Destination Port | **3389** |

    > **Note**: **10.62.0.4** represents the private IP address of **<6+2>-az104-06-vm2**

1. Click **Check** and wait until results of the connectivity check are returned. Verify that the status is **Reachable**. Review the network path and note that the connection was direct, with no intermediate hops in between the VMs.

    > **Note**: This is expected, since the hub virtual network is peered directly with the first spoke virtual network.

1. On the **Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot** blade, initiate a check with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource group | **<6+2>-az104-06-rg1** |

    | Virtual machine | **<6+2>-az104-06-vm0** |
    | Destination | **Specify manually** |
    | URI, FQDN or IPv4 | **10.63.0.4** |
    | Protocol | **TCP** |
    | Destination Port | **3389** |

    > **Note**: **10.63.0.4** represents the private IP address of **<6+2>-az104-06-vm3**

1. Click **Check** and wait until results of the connectivity check are returned. Verify that the status is **Reachable**. Review the network path and note that the connection was direct, with no intermediate hops in between the VMs.

    > **Note**: This is expected, since the hub virtual network is peered directly with the second spoke virtual network.

1. On the **Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot** blade, initiate a check with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource group | **<6+2>-az104-06-rg1** |
    | Source type | **Virtual machine** |
    | Virtual machine | **<6+2>-az104-06-vm2** |
    | Destination | **Specify manually** |
    | URI, FQDN or IPv4 | **10.63.0.4** |
    | Protocol | **TCP** |
    | Destination Port | **3389** |

1. Click **Check** and wait until results of the connectivity check are returned. Note that the status is **Unreachable**.

    > **Note**: This is expected, since the two spoke virtual networks are not peered with each other (virtual network peering is not transitive).

#### Task 4: Configure routing in the hub and spoke topology

In this task, you will configure and test routing between the two spoke virtual networks by enabling IP forwarding on the network interface of the **<6+2>-az104-06-vm0** virtual machine, enabling routing within its operating system, and configuring user-defined routes on the spoke virtual network.

1. In the Azure portal, search and select **Virtual machines**.

1. Select **Frontend IP configuration** from the Load Balancer resource page. Copy the IP address.

1. Open another browser tab and navigate to the IP address. Verify that the browser window displays the message **Hello World from <6+2>-az104-06-vm0** or **Hello World from <6+2>-az104-06-vm1**.

1. Refresh the window to verify the message changes to the other virtual machine. This demonstrates the load balancer rotating through the virtual machines.

    > **Note**: You may need to refresh more than once or open a new browser window in InPrivate mode.

#### Task 6: Implement Azure Application Gateway

In this task, you will implement an Azure Application Gateway in front of the two Azure virtual machines in the spoke virtual networks.

1. In the Azure portal, search and select **Virtual networks**.

1. On the **Virtual networks** blade, in the list of virtual networks, click **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet01**.

1. On the  **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet01** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Subnets**, and then click **+ Subnet**.

1. Add a subnet with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | **subnet-appgw** |
    | Subnet address range | **10.60.3.224/27** |

1. Click **Save**

    > **Note**: This subnet will be used by the Azure Application Gateway instances, which you will deploy later in this task. The Application Gateway requires a dedicated subnet of /27 or larger size.

1. In the Azure portal, search and select **Application Gateways** and, on the **Application Gateways** blade, click **+ Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource group | **<6+2>-az104-06-rg5** (create new) |
    | Application gateway name | **<6+2>-az104-06-appgw5** |
    | Region | name of the Azure region into which you deployed all other resources in this lab |
    | Tier | **Standard V2** |
    | Enable autoscaling | **No** |
	| Instance count | **2** |
	| Availability zone | **None** |
    | HTTP2 | **Disabled** |
    | Virtual network | **<6+2>-az104-06-vnet01** |
    | Subnet | **subnet-appgw (10.60.3.224/27)** |

1. Click **Next: Frontends >** and specify the following settings (leave others with their default values). When complete, click **OK**. 

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Frontend IP address type | **Public** |
    | Public IP address| **Add new** | 
	| Name | **<6+2>-az104-06-pip5** |
	| Availability zone | **None** |

1. Click **Next: Backends >** and then **Add a backend pool**. Specify the following settings (leave others with their default values). When completed click **Add**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | **<6+2>-az104-06-appgw5-be1** |
    | Add backend pool without targets | **No** |
    | IP address or FQDN | **10.62.0.4** | 
    | IP address or FQDN | **10.63.0.4** |

    > **Note**: The targets represent the private IP addresses of virtual machines in the spoke virtual networks **<6+2>-az104-06-vm2** and **<6+2>-az104-06-vm3**.

1. Click **Next: Configuration >** and then **+ Add a routing rule**. Specify the following settings:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Rule name | **<6+2>-az104-06-appgw5-rl1** |
    | Priority | **10** |
    | Listener name | **<6+2>-az104-06-appgw5-rl1l1** |
    | Frontend IP | **Public** |
    | Protocol | **HTTP** |
    | Port | **80** |
    | Listener type | **Basic** |
    | Error page url | **No** |

1. Switch to the **Backend targets** tab and specify the following settings (leave others with their default values). When completed click **Add** (twice).  

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Target type | **Backend pool** |
    | Backend target | **<6+2>-az104-06-appgw5-be1** |
	| Backend settings | **Add new** |
    | Backend settings name | **<6+2>-az104-06-appgw5-http1** |
    | Backend protocol | **HTTP** |
    | Backend port | **80** |
    | Additional settings | **take the defaults** |
    | Host name | **take the defaults** |

1. Click **Next: Tags >**, followed by **Next: Review + create >** and then click **Create**.

    > **Note**: Wait for the Application Gateway instance to be created. This might take about 8 minutes.

1. In the Azure portal, search and select **Application Gateways** and, on the **Application Gateways** blade, click **<6+2>-az104-06-appgw5**.

1. On the **<6+2>-az104-06-appgw5** Application Gateway blade, copy the value of the **Frontend public IP address**.

1. Start another browser window and navigate to the IP address you identified in the previous step.

1. Verify that the browser window displays the message **Hello World from <6+2>-az104-06-vm2** or **Hello World from <6+2>-az104-06-vm3**.

1. Refresh the window to verify the message changes to the other virtual machine. 

    > **Note**: You may need to refresh more than once or open a new browser window in InPrivate mode.

    > **Note**: Targeting virtual machines on multiple virtual networks is not a common configuration, but it is meant to illustrate the point that Application Gateway is capable of targeting virtual machines on multiple virtual networks (as well as endpoints in other Azure regions or even outside of Azure), unlike Azure Load Balancer, which load balances across virtual machines in the same virtual network.

#### Clean up resources

>**Note**: Remember to remove the resource group that you created.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name '<6+2>*' | Remove-AzResourceGroup
   ```

    >**Note**: The command executes and takes some time for the execution.
